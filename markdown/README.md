# Introduction

This file contains the full documentation for Eko's developer APIs in markdown format.

This section contains the general information about the API, including the base URL, the version, and the authentication methods.

## 1. API Base URLs

- **Production:** `https://api.eko.in/ekoicici/v3`
- **Sandbox/UAT:** `https://staging.eko.in/ekoapi/v3`

## 2. Developer Portal Links

- **Guides:** [https://developers.eko.in/docs](https://developers.eko.in/docs)
- **API References:** [https://developers.eko.in/reference](https://developers.eko.in/reference)

## 3. Authentication

To ensure the security & integrity of your data, you must authenticate each API call by passing the following headers:

| Header | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **developer_key** | string | Your static API key shared by Eko |
| **secret-key** | string | Dynamic security key, to be generated before every request |
| **secret-key-timestamp** | string | The request timestamp, used to generate the secret-key |
| **request_hash** | string | This is required only for financial transactions. See the guide below. |

### How to get the _developer_key_?

Production developer_key will be shared after the following is done:
1.  Organisation's KYC is completed on Eko's platform (visit [https://connect.eko.in](https://connect.eko.in)).
2.  The UAT **developer\_key** can be obtained from the [platform credentials](https://developers.eko.in/v3/docs/platform-credentials) section.

### How to generate the _secret-key_ & _secret-key-timestamp_?

1. Eko will provide an _access\_key_. It must be kept a secret on your backend. If compromised, it can be regenerated.
   1.  The access\_key will be shared to you over email, after completing your organisation's KYC at [https://connect.eko.in](https://connect.eko.in)
   2.  For UAT, use the following access\_key: d2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30
2. Encode the _access\_key_ using base64 encoding.
3. Get the current timestamp (in milliseconds since UNIX epoch). It will be used as the **secret-key-timestamp**. (Check [currentmillis.com](https://currentmillis.com/) to understand the timestamp format)
4. Compute the signature by hashing salt and base64 encoded key using Hash-based message authentication code HMAC and SHA256
5. Encode the signature using base64 encoding technique. This encoded value is your **secret-key**.

#### Example Code (PHP)

```php
<?php
    $access_key = "d2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30"; // DO NOT STORE IT HERE. Read it from env or configuration files

    // Encode it using base64
    $encodedKey = base64_encode($access_key);

    // Get current timestamp in milliseconds since UNIX epoch as STRING
    // Check out https://currentmillis.com to understand the timestamp format
    $secret_key_timestamp = (int)(round(microtime(true) * 1000));

    // Computes the signature by hashing the salt with the encoded key
    $signature = hash_hmac('SHA256', $secret_key_timestamp, $encodedKey, true);

    // Encode it using base64
    $secret_key = base64_encode($signature);

    //Display
    echo "secret-key: " . $secret_key. "\n";
    echo "secret-key-timestamp: " . $secret_key_timestamp . "\n";
?>
```

> **Note:**
> 1.  The secret-key-timestamp must match with the current time.
> 2.  **If you are using .NET**, you should not send overly specific time stamps, due to differing interpretations of how extra time precision should be dropped. To avoid overly specific time stamps, manually construct dateTime objects with no more than millisecond precision.


### How to generate the _request\_hash_?

The _request\_hash_ header is only required for financial transactions for a certain amount which needs to be debited from your Eko wallet or your agent's Eko wallet (E-value).

It is used to encode critical parameters of your financial transaction such as amount, agent, recipient, etc. It ensures that the values have been validated on your server and they have not been tampered with.

Before generating the request hash you need to generate a string by concatenating some parameters in a particular order. You cannot change the sequence.

For example, sequence of concatenated string for Bill Payments = `secret_key_timestamp + utility_acc_no + amount + user_code`

After generating the concatenated string please follow the following procedure :

1. Encode your authenticator password using base64. Authenticator password will be the _access\_key_ which you have used for the secret-key generation.
   1. For UAT, the access\_key is "d2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30".
2. After encoding the key, you need to hmac the concatenated string and encoded\_key using hmac256.
3. After hmac , you need to again encode the result using the base64.

Final result after encoding will be the request\_hash.



#### Sample Code to Generate _request\_hash_ (PHP):

**Note:** The following example generates the request\_hash for the Bill Payment API by concatenating secret\_key\_timestamp, utility\_acc\_no, amount, and user\_code (in the same order). For APIs, a different set of parameters may be required. See the corresponding API docs for details.

```php
<?php

const HMAC_SHA256 = 'sha256';

function generateRequestHashForBillPay() {
	try {
    	$access_key = 'd2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30'; // DO NOT STORE IT HERE. Read it from env or configuration files
    	$encodedKey = base64_encode($access_key);
    	$timestamp = round(microtime(true) * 1000);
     	$secret_key_timestamp = (string) $timestamp;

    	$secret_key = base64_encode(hash_hmac(HMAC_SHA256, $secret_key_timestamp, $encodedKey, true));

    	$utility_acc_no = '151627591';
    	$amount = '50';
    	$user_code = '20810200';

    	$concatenatedString = $secret_key_timestamp . $utility_acc_no . $amount . $user_code;
    	$request_hash = base64_encode(hash_hmac(HMAC_SHA256, $concatenatedString, $encodedKey, true));

    	echo "secret-key: $secret_key\n";
    	echo "secret-key-timestamp: $secret_key_timestamp\n";
    	echo "request_hash: $request_hash\n";
	} catch (Exception $e) {
    	echo $e->getMessage();
	}
}
?>
```

### Response Status Codes

For all financial transactions, **_status = 0_** should be treated as successful else fail and the current state of the transaction can be retrieved from **_tx\_status_** and **_txstatus\_desc_** parameter.

For all non-financial requests, you may need to consider both status and response\_type\_id parameters.

# Common APIs

### 1. Transaction Inquiry API

Get the status of a transaction using Eko TID or client_ref_id

#### Details
- **Method:** GET
- **URL Endpoint:** /tools/reference/transaction/{transaction-reference}
- **Request Structure:**
  - Path Parameters:
    - transaction-reference (string / required) - Eko TID or your client_ref_id that uniquely identifies the transaction
  - Query Parameters:
    - initiator_id (number / required) - Your registered mobile number (See Platform Credentials for UAT)
    - user_code (string / required) - Unique code of your registered agent/retailer


#### Description
**Examples:**
To check the status of a transaction using TID 12345, use following endpoint: `/tools/reference/transaction/12345

In case you have not received Eko's TID (say, due to network timeout), you can enquire about the status of a transaction using your own unique reference number (say, 567890) by using the following endpoint format: `/tools/reference/transaction/567890`

**Transaction Timeout:**
A transaction can timeout due to multiple reasons where partner bank responses could be slow or due to network connectivity, delayed or no response may occur.

In such cases transactions should not be treated as declined or failed. Ideally, it should be inquired using the Transaction Inquiry API by passing your own unique reference number i.e. client_ref_id.

Possible values of parameter *tx_status*:

- Fetch bill by calling the Get Operator Parameters API to get the required parameters for a particular biller/operator.
- Parameters name passed in the payment API should match exactly as param_name returned in the API.
- The parameter value entered by the user should be verified as per the param_type and regex returned.
- Just before calling the payment API, generate the secret-key-timestamp, secret-key, and request-hash.

  },
  "response_type_id": 1888,
  "message": "successfully generated QR code",
  "status": 0
}
```

#### Description
Eko’s QR Payment API provides an end-to-end solution from QR code generation to payment collection. The transaction flow is as follows:

1. Activate your service for QR using Activate Service for Agent API and passing `service_code = 59`.
2. The user provides their mobile number that is the `sender_id` against which their QR code is generated.
3. If any payment is made against the QR code, the amount is reflected in the partner's wallet.
4. After the transaction, the callback request with the transaction details is sent to the partner. The transaction status of a particular transaction can be checked using the Transaction Inquiry API.

**Note:**
- To cross-check the QR code that was used for a transaction, check if the `client_ref_id` in the callback matches the `utility_acc_no` in the generated QR. If they are the same, you've identified the QR code used for the transaction.
- For each `sender_id`, only one QR string can be generated.


### 2. Generate Dynamic QR (UPI) API
