# Introduction

This file contains the full documentation for Eko's developer APIs in markdown format.

This section contains the general information about the API, including the base URL, the version, and the authentication methods.

## 1. API Base URLs

- **Sandbox/UAT Base URL:** https://staging.eko.in/ekoapi/v3
- **Production Base URL:** https://api.eko.in:25002/ekoicici/v3

## 2. Eko Developer Portal Links

- **Guides:** [https://developers.eko.in/docs](https://developers.eko.in/docs)
- **API References:** [https://developers.eko.in/reference](https://developers.eko.in/reference)

## 3. Authentication

To ensure the security & integrity of your data, you must authenticate each API call by passing the credentials in the header for each API call.

You will receive the following credentials from Eko:
1. `developer_key`: This value is passed in the header for each API call.
   1. For production environment, Eko will provide this value to you.
   2. For UAT/Sandbox/Testing environment, use this value for `developer_key`: becbbce45f79c6f5109f848acd540567
2. `access_key`: This value is required to generate the `secret-key` which needs to be passed in the header for each API call.
   1. For production environment, Eko will provide this value to you.
   2. For UAT/Sandbox/Testing environment, use this value for `access-key`: d2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30

Pass the following credentials in the header for each API call:
| Header | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `developer_key` | string | Your static API key shared by Eko |
| `secret-key` | string | Dynamic security key, to be generated before every request |
| `secret-key-timestamp` | string | The request timestamp, used to generate the secret-key |
| `request_hash` | string | This is required only for financial transactions where your wallet needs to be debited |


#### How to get the authentication credentials for production?

1. Fill the form at [https://developers.eko.in](https://developers.eko.in).
2. Eko's support team will get in touch with you to complete your KYC and provide the production credentials: `developer_key` and `access_key`.


#### How to generate the `secret-key` & `secret-key-timestamp`?

1. Eko will provide an `access_key` for production. It must be kept a secret on your backend. If compromised, it can be regenerated.
2. Encode the `access_key` using base64 encoding.
3. Get the current timestamp (in milliseconds since UNIX epoch). It will be used as the `secret-key-timestamp` and passed in the header. (Check [currentmillis.com](https://currentmillis.com/) to understand the timestamp format).
4. Compute the signature by hashing salt and base64 encoded key using Hash-based message authentication code HMAC and SHA256
5. Encode the signature using base64 encoding technique. This encoded value is your `secret-key`.

##### Example Code (PHP)

```php
<?php
    $access_key = "d2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30"; // DO NOT STORE IT HERE. Read it from env or configuration files

    // Encode it using base64
    $encodedKey = base64_encode($access_key);

    // Get current timestamp in milliseconds since UNIX epoch as STRING
    // Check out https://currentmillis.com to understand the timestamp format
    $secret_key_timestamp = (int)(round(microtime(true) * 1000));

    // Computes the signature by hashing the salt with the encoded key
    $signature = hash_hmac('SHA256', $secret_key_timestamp, $encodedKey, true);

    // Encode it using base64
    $secret_key = base64_encode($signature);

    //Display
    echo "secret-key: " . $secret_key. "\n";
    echo "secret-key-timestamp: " . $secret_key_timestamp . "\n";
?>
```

**Note:**
1.  The `secret-key-timestamp` must match with the current time.
2.  **If you are using .NET**, you should not send overly specific time stamps, due to differing interpretations of how extra time precision should be dropped. To avoid overly specific time stamps, manually construct dateTime objects with no more than millisecond precision.


#### How to generate the `request_hash`?

The `request_hash` header is only required for financial transactions where money needs to be debited from your Eko wallet or your agent's Eko wallet (E-value).

It is used to encode critical parameters of your financial transaction such as amount, agent, recipient, etc. It ensures that the values have been validated on your server and they have not been tampered with.

Before generating the request hash you need to generate a string by concatenating some parameters in a particular order. You cannot change the sequence.

For example, sequence of concatenated string for Bill Payments = `secret_key_timestamp` + `utility_acc_no` + `amount` + `user_code`

This information is provided in the documentation for each API where the `request_hash` is required.

After generating the concatenated string, do the following to generate the `request_hash`:

1. Encode your authenticator password using base64. Authenticator password will be the `access_key` which you have used for the secret-key generation.
2. After encoding the key, you need to hmac the concatenated string and encoded_key using HMAC256.
3. After HMAC, you need to again encode the result using base64.

Final result after encoding will be the `request_hash`.


##### Sample Code to Generate `request_hash` (PHP):

**Note:** The following example generates the `request_hash` for the Bill Payment API by concatenating `secret_key_timestamp`, `utility_acc_no`, `amount`, and `user_code` (in the same order). For other APIs, a different set of parameters may be required. See the corresponding API docs for details.

```php
<?php

const HMAC_SHA256 = 'sha256';

function generateRequestHashForBillPay() {
	try {
    	$access_key = 'd2fe1d99-6298-4af2-8cc5-d97dcf46df30'; // DO NOT STORE IT HERE. Read it from env or configuration files
    	$encodedKey = base64_encode($access_key);
    	$timestamp = round(microtime(true) * 1000);
     	$secret_key_timestamp = (string) $timestamp;

    	$secret_key = base64_encode(hash_hmac(HMAC_SHA256, $secret_key_timestamp, $encodedKey, true));

    	$utility_acc_no = '151627591';
    	$amount = '50';
    	$user_code = '20810200';

    	$concatenatedString = $secret_key_timestamp . $utility_acc_no . $amount . $user_code;
    	$request_hash = base64_encode(hash_hmac(HMAC_SHA256, $concatenatedString, $encodedKey, true));

    	echo "secret-key: $secret_key\n";
    	echo "secret-key-timestamp: $secret_key_timestamp\n";
    	echo "request_hash: $request_hash\n";
	} catch (Exception $e) {
    	echo $e->getMessage();
	}
}
?>
```

# Common APIs

### 1. Transaction Inquiry API

Get the status of a transaction using Eko TID or client_ref_id

#### Details
- **Method:** GET
- **URL Endpoint:** /tools/reference/transaction/{transaction-reference}
- **Request Structure:**
  - Path Parameters:
    - transaction-reference (string / required) - Eko TID or your client_ref_id that uniquely identifies the transaction
  - Query Parameters:
    - initiator_id (number / required) - Your registered mobile number (See Platform Credentials for UAT)
    - user_code (string / required) - Unique code of your registered agent/retailer


#### Description
**Examples:**
To check the status of a transaction using TID 12345, use following endpoint: `/tools/reference/transaction/12345

In case you have not received Eko's TID (say, due to network timeout), you can enquire about the status of a transaction using your own unique reference number (say, 567890) by using the following endpoint format: `/tools/reference/transaction/567890`

**Transaction Timeout:**
A transaction can timeout due to multiple reasons where partner bank responses could be slow or due to network connectivity, delayed or no response may occur.

In such cases transactions should not be treated as declined or failed. Ideally, it should be inquired using the Transaction Inquiry API by passing your own unique reference number i.e. client_ref_id.

Possible values of parameter *tx_status*:
| tx_status | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | Success                                      |
| 1          | Fail                                         |
| 2          | Response Awaited/Initiated (in case of NEFT) |
| 3          | Refund Pending                               |
| 4          | Refunded                                     |
| 5          | Hold (Transaction Inquiry Required)          |


### 2. Transaction Status Callback (Webhook)

Provide your own API (webhook) URL to receive updates about the status of following types of transactions: DMT, Fund Transfer, QR, and CMS.

You can configure your own API endpoint (web-hook) to receive callbacks about the status of any transaction. This endpoint will be used by Eko to update the transaction status. We will assume that the update request has been acknowledged upon receiving a status 200 “Success” from the endpoint.

Note - The callback will be sent only when the status of the transaction is updated from initiated to success or failed.

> URL Structure:
>
> Note that only static URL structures are supported.
>
> **URL Structure:** [https://foo.bar/path](https://foo.bar/path)
>
> **Method:** POST

We will send the following payload when we hit your URL:

```json
{
    "tx_status": 0,
    "amount": 120.0,
    "payment_mode": "5",
    "txstatus_desc": "SUCCESS",
    "fee": 5.0,
    "gst": 0.76,
    "sender_name": "Flipkarti",

  "message": "successfully generated QR code",

}
```

#### Description
Eko’s QR Payment API provides an end-to-end solution from QR code generation to payment collection. The transaction flow is as follows:

1. Activate your service for QR using Activate Service for Agent API and passing `service_code = 59`.
2. The user provides their mobile number that is the `sender_id` against which their QR code is generated.
3. If any payment is made against the QR code, the amount is reflected in the partner's wallet.
4. After the transaction, the callback request with the transaction details is sent to the partner. The transaction status of a particular transaction can be checked using the Transaction Inquiry API.

**Note:**
- To cross-check the QR code that was used for a transaction, check if the `client_ref_id` in the callback matches the `utility_acc_no` in the generated QR. If they are the same, you've identified the QR code used for the transaction.
- For each `sender_id`, only one QR string can be generated.


### 2. Generate Dynamic QR (UPI) API
