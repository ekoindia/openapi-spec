    This is a **work-in-progress** OpenAPI specification for the EPS developer platform.

    # Introduction

    This API definition is intended to to be a good starting point for
    describing your API in

    [OpenAPI/Swagger
    format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).

    It also demonstrates features of
    [create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool
    and

    [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. So beyond
    the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few

    [vendor
    extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).


    # OpenAPI Specification

    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
    language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which

    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
    of the service without access to source

    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
    defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can

    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
    implementation logic. Similar to what

    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
    guesswork in calling the service.

        The name matching is only for the production, on staging we won't be matching the name from PAN verification and in the request.

        ### Mandatory Parameyters for AePS Activation:

        For the AePS activation, you need to pass user_code, initiator_id, service_code = 43 or 1, modelname, devicenumber, office_address, address_as_per_proof, pan_card as mandatory and either of voter_card_front and voter_card_back or aadhar_front and aadhar_back.

        Either of Voter Card or Aadhaar Card is required.
        If you are sending voter card send in the parameters voter_card_front and voter_card_back. If you are sending Aadhaar card send in the parameters aadhar_front and aadhar_back.

        By activating AePS for merchants using the new service code = 43, they will be able to conduct AePS transactions instantly. If we find any mismatch in documents, the merchant’s AePS business will be paused. We will communicate the same to you within 24 working hours of merchant activation and ask for re-uploading updated documents. Post re-upload, the business will continue as usual.
        Note - We highly recommend to activate all new AePS merchants using the new service code = 43 to benefit from seamless integration.
        Please note that if you do not change service code = 1, all your merchants will be on-boarded using the current flow with a 7 working day TAT for merchant activation.

        ### AePS Activation TAT
        After activation, the user state goes into pending state and it will take 3 business days for any user to get activated for AePS.

        ### Please Note:
        1. In case of AePS service activation, the user_code is the unique code received in response to the Onboard User API
        2. Either of Voter Card or Aadhaar Card is required.
        3. If you are sending voter card send in the parameters voter_card_front and voter_card_back. If you are sending aadhaar card send int the parameters aadhar_front and aadhar_back
        4. The file size for the documents for AePS activation should be less than 1MB.
        5. We accept the images in JPEG, JPG and PDF format, not in PNG. PNG images are rejected from the partner bank.
