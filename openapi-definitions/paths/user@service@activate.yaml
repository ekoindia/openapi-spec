      Activate a particular service for your agent/user.

      ### Mandatory Parameyters for AePS Activation:

      For the AePS activation, you need to pass user_code, initiator_id, service_code = 43 or 1, modelname, devicenumber, office_address, address_as_per_proof, pan_card as mandatory and either of voter_card_front and voter_card_back or aadhar_front and aadhar_back.

      Either of Voter Card or Aadhaar Card is required.
      If you are sending voter card send in the parameters voter_card_front and voter_card_back. If you are sending Aadhaar card send in the parameters aadhar_front and aadhar_back.

      By activating AePS for merchants using the new service code = 43, they will be able to conduct AePS transactions instantly. If we find any mismatch in documents, the merchantâ€™s AePS business will be paused. We will communicate the same to you within 24 working hours of merchant activation and ask for re-uploading updated documents. Post re-upload, the business will continue as usual.
      Note - We highly recommend to activate all new AePS merchants using the new service code = 43 to benefit from seamless integration.
      Please note that if you do not change service code = 1, all your merchants will be on-boarded using the current flow with a 7 working day TAT for merchant activation.

      ### AePS Activation TAT
      After activation, the user state goes into pending state and it will take 3 business days for any user to get activated for AePS.

      ### Please Note:
      1. In case of AePS service activation, the user_code is the unique code received in response to the Onboard User API
      2. Either of Voter Card or Aadhaar Card is required.
      3. If you are sending voter card send in the parameters voter_card_front and voter_card_back. If you are sending aadhaar card send int the parameters aadhar_front and aadhar_back
      4. The file size for the documents for AePS activation should be less than 1MB.
      5. We accept the images in JPEG, JPG and PDF format, not in PNG. PNG images are rejected from the partner bank.
